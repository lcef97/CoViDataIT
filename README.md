## CoViDataIT R package

At the time being, this package only consists in a function to retrieve CoViD cases data.
Further developments could be made, and development requests are encouraged at this stage.

May or may not be shared on CRAN, but not at this stage.

Unfortunately, it seems data are not available anymore after January 10th 2025. 
This poses a doubt on whether to spend time and energy to improve or maintain this package:
does it hold a point, or is it a sterile exercise in R programming?

[Newspaper](https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/coronavirus/) talks about a "Transmission problem of the Ministry".

A primordial vignette draft is [here](https://lcef97.github.io/CoViDataIT/) (ongoing)
